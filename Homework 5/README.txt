To run the script, make sure that the script and text file are in the same directory.

Then, run a command in the following format:

"python hw5p5.py [name of text file containing wrestlers and rivalries]"

For example, if the name of the text file is "wrestler.txt", the command would be:

"python hw5p5.py wrestler.txt"
